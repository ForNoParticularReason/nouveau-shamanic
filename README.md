I would like to find a way to embrace what Led Zeppelin did, applied to software development

I am trying to create a kind of a cultural understanding through my muse that is part of the zeitgeist that isn't motivated by requirements or features or tickets. It's more, not counter-architectual, but counter-design.

Today you’re called psychotic if you do that, but it’s all semantics.
